%====================


I'm a fresh graduate with a Master's Degree in Data Science from EPFL. My study path was focused on learning the Mathematics behind Machine Learning and getting hands-on practice for the model building pipeline: from data extraction to model optimization. I'm greatly motivated by applying the FOSS philosophy to science, for it to be accessible to everyone and collaborative. To continue my journey in this field, I want to find a motivating and enjoyable environment where I can bring a meaningful contribution using AI.
