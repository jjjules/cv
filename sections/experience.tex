% I developed a production-ready personalized spaced repetition algorithm for the AI tutor of the start-up, ARI 9000. I
% designed a novel algorithm approach based on a Neural Network architecture that predicts the probability of
% correctness of users on problems at any given time. Predictions can then be used to choose which problems to
% reactivate to help users learn as efficiently as possible.\\
