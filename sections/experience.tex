I participate in the development of the application and more specifically the algorithm designs focused on AI. I also
am continuing the work done during the internship by setting up the developed algorithm's deployment.

% I developed a production-ready personalized spaced repetition algorithm for the AI tutor of the start-up, ARI 9000. I
% designed a novel algorithm approach based on a Neural Network architecture that predicts the probability of
% correctness of users on problems at any given time. Predictions can then be used to choose which problems to
% reactivate to help users learn as efficiently as possible.\\

%I helped the students understand the course material as well as with their coding projects. These projects focused on using
%Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques on problems using concrete real-world datasets (recommender systems,
%community detection, information retrieval, etc.). It used Python as well as distributed processing tools like Hadoop and Apache Spark.
