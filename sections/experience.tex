\subsection{Data Science Intern, Machine Learning Engineer \hfill July 2022 --- February 2024}

\subtext{Magma Learning, Lausanne}
\vspace{0.7\baselineskip}

First as an intern working on my Master's thesis and then as a Machine Learning Engineer, I led the design, creation, deployment, and integration of our spaced repetition model. This involved extensive exploration, feature engineering, model training, and integration into the backend, with real-time inference capabilities in production. It allowed to significantly improve the personalization of our app, delivering content to users at optimal learning moments.

I played a pivotal role in backend development, including implementing NLP features and designing database models (PostgreSQL, DynamoDB). I also made significant improvements in the frontend, and the restructuration and migration of our services to AWS.

% I developed a production-ready personalized spaced repetition algorithm for the AI tutor of the company. I
% designed a novel algorithm approach based on a Neural Network architecture that predicts the probability of
% correctness of users on problems at any given time. Predictions can then be used to choose which problems to
% reactivate to help users learn as efficiently as possible.\\

%I helped the students understand the course material as well as with their coding projects. These projects focused on using
%Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques on problems using concrete real-world datasets (recommender systems,
%community detection, information retrieval, etc.). It used Python as well as distributed processing tools like Hadoop and Apache Spark.
